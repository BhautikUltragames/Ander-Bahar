# Andar Bahar WebSocket Server

This is the Node.js WebSocket server for the Andar Bahar multiplayer game. The server comes with bundled Node.js runtime, so no separate Node.js installation is required.

## ‚úÖ Current Status: Fully Working

The WebSocket server is production-ready and handles all multiplayer functionality including:

- Room creation and management
- Real-time game synchronization
- Player authentication and balancing
- Automatic cleanup and reconnection handling

## üöÄ Quick Start

### **Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
# From project root directory
.\start_server.bat
```

### **Linux/Mac**

```bash
# From project root directory
chmod +x start_server.sh
./start_server.sh
```

### **Manual Start (if batch files don't work)**

```bash
# Using bundled Node.js (Windows)
cd server
..\server\node-v22.17.0-win-x64\npm.cmd install
..\server\node-v22.17.0-win-x64\node.exe server.js

# Using system Node.js (if available)
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

## üèóÔ∏è Server Architecture

### **Game Rooms**

- Each room has a unique 8-character room ID (e.g., "A1B2C3D4")
- Supports 2-6 players per room (minimum 2 to start)
- Host (room creator) has special privileges
- Automatic cleanup of empty rooms after all players leave

### **Game Flow**

1. **Waiting Phase**: Players join the room, host can start when ready
2. **Betting Phase**: 5-second synchronized timer for placing bets
3. **Ready to Play**: Brief transition phase after betting ends
4. **Dealing Phase**: Cards dealt alternately until match found
5. **Show Result**: Display winner and calculate payouts
6. **New Round**: Automatic restart after 5 seconds

### **WebSocket Messages**

#### **Client to Server Messages:**

- `createRoom`: Create a new game room

  ```json
  { "type": "createRoom", "playerName": "Player1" }
  ```

- `joinRoom`: Join an existing room

  ```json
  { "type": "joinRoom", "roomId": "A1B2C3D4", "playerName": "Player2" }
  ```

- `leaveRoom`: Leave current room

  ```json
  { "type": "leaveRoom", "roomId": "A1B2C3D4" }
  ```

- `startGame`: Start game (host only)

  ```json
  { "type": "startGame", "roomId": "A1B2C3D4" }
  ```

- `placeBet`: Place a bet during betting phase

  ```json
  { "type": "placeBet", "roomId": "A1B2C3D4", "side": "andar", "amount": 100 }
  ```

- `getRooms`: Get list of available rooms
  ```json
  { "type": "getRooms" }
  ```

#### **Server to Client Messages:**

- `roomCreated`: Room creation confirmation

  ```json
  {
    "type": "roomCreated",
    "roomId": "A1B2C3D4",
    "playerId": "uuid-string",
    "roomInfo": { "roomId": "A1B2C3D4", "playerCount": 1, "maxPlayers": 6 }
  }
  ```

- `roomJoined`: Room join confirmation
- `leftRoom`: Room leave confirmation
- `gameState`: Current game state update (sent frequently)
- `roomList`: List of available rooms
- `error`: Error messages

## üéØ Game Rules Implementation

### **Betting System**

- **Available Bet Amounts**: 25, 50, 100, 250, 500 chips
- **Starting Balance**: 5000 chips per player
- **Betting Time**: 5 seconds for all players to place bets
- **Multiple Bets**: Players can change their bet during the betting phase

### **Payout System**

- **Andar Wins**: 0.9:1 payout (bet ‚Çπ100, win ‚Çπ190 total)
- **Bahar Wins**: 1:1 payout (bet ‚Çπ100, win ‚Çπ200 total)
- **Balance Updates**: Real-time balance synchronization across all clients

### **Card Dealing Logic**

- **Deck**: Standard 52-card deck, shuffled at start of each round
- **Joker Selection**: Random card from deck becomes the target
- **Dealing Pattern**:
  - **Black Joker** (‚ô£‚ô†): First card goes to Andar, then alternates
  - **Red Joker** (‚ô•‚ô¶): First card goes to Bahar, then alternates
- **Win Condition**: First side to receive a card matching Joker's rank wins

## üîß Configuration

### **Server Settings**

```javascript
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 8080; // Default port 8080
const MAX_PLAYERS_PER_ROOM = 6; // Maximum players per room
const BETTING_TIME = 10000; // 10 seconds betting time
const RECONNECTION_GRACE = 30000; // 30 seconds reconnection grace
```

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# Optional: Change server port
PORT=3000

# Optional: Enable debug logging
DEBUG=true
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **1. Server won't start**

**Windows PowerShell Error:**

```
start_server.bat : The term 'start_server.bat' is not recognized
```

**Solution:**

```powershell
# Use .\ prefix in PowerShell
.\start_server.bat
```

#### **2. Port already in use**

**Error:**

```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::8080
```

**Solutions:**

```bash
# Option 1: Change port
PORT=3001 npm start

# Option 2: Kill process using port 8080 (Windows)
netstat -ano | findstr :8080
taskkill /PID <process-id> /F

# Option 2: Kill process using port 8080 (Linux/Mac)
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill
```

#### **3. WebSocket connection failed**

**Client Error:** `WebSocketChannelException: WebSocket connection failed`

**Solutions:**

- Ensure server is running (look for "Andar Bahar WebSocket server running on port 8080")
- Check firewall settings
- Verify correct server URL in Flutter app (default: ws://localhost:8080)
- Try restarting both server and client

#### **4. Players can't join rooms**

**Possible Causes:**

- Room ID is incorrect (case-sensitive, 8 characters)
- Room is full (maximum 6 players)
- Room is not in 'waiting' phase (game already started)

### **Debug Information**

The server provides comprehensive logging:

```bash
# Connection events
New client connected
Client disconnected

# Room management
Room A1B2C3D4 created by Player1
Player2 joined room A1B2C3D4
Room A1B2C3D4 deleted (empty)

# Game events
Game started in room A1B2C3D4
Player1 placed bet: 100 on andar
```

## üìä Performance & Monitoring

### **Current Performance**

- **Concurrent Rooms**: Tested with 10+ simultaneous rooms
- **Players per Room**: Up to 6 players with smooth synchronization
- **Response Time**: Sub-100ms for local network communication
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient room cleanup prevents memory leaks

### **Monitoring Commands**

```bash
# Check server status
curl http://localhost:8080

# Monitor server logs
tail -f server.log  # If logging to file

# Check memory usage (Linux/Mac)
ps aux | grep node

# Check memory usage (Windows)
tasklist | findstr node
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

### **For Local Network Deployment**

The current setup is perfect for local network play:

```bash
# Start server on local network
.\start_server.bat

# Players can connect using host's IP
# Example: ws://192.168.1.100:8080
```

### **For Cloud Deployment**

For public internet deployment, consider:

1. **Process Management**: Use PM2 or similar

   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server.js --name andar-bahar-server
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```

2. **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx for WebSocket proxying

   ```nginx
   location /ws {
       proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
       proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
   }
   ```

3. **SSL/TLS**: Enable secure WebSocket connections (wss://)
4. **Environment Variables**: Set PORT and other config via env vars
5. **Database**: Add persistent storage for user accounts and statistics
6. **Load Balancing**: Scale horizontally with multiple server instances

## üß™ Development & Testing

### **Development Mode**

```bash
# Start with auto-restart on file changes
cd server
npm run dev  # Uses nodemon if available
```

### **Testing WebSocket Connection**

```javascript
// Test WebSocket connection in browser console
const ws = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080");
ws.onopen = () => console.log("Connected");
ws.onmessage = (event) => console.log("Message:", event.data);
ws.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "getRooms" }));
```

### **Load Testing**

```bash
# Install WebSocket testing tool
npm install -g wscat

# Test connection
wscat -c ws://localhost:8080

# Send test messages
> {"type": "createRoom", "playerName": "TestPlayer"}
```
