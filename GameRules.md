## 📋 How to Play

   - Multiplayer: All players have 5 seconds to place bets

### **Step 2: Joker Reveal**

- A random card is drawn and placed in the center as the "Joker"
- This card determines the target rank to match
- The joker's color determines the dealing pattern

### **Step 3: Card Dealing**

- Cards are dealt alternately to Andar and Bahar sides
- **Starting Rule**:
  - **Black Joker** (♣ Clubs, ♠ Spades): First card goes to **Andar**
  - **Red Joker** (♥ Hearts, ♦ Diamonds): First card goes to **Bahar**
- Cards continue alternating until a match is found

### **Step 4: Winning**

- The first side to receive a card matching the Joker's rank wins

- 100 chips
- 250 chips

### **Payout Ratios**

- **Andar Wins**: 0.9:1 (bet 100, win 190 total)
- **Bahar Wins**: 1:1 (bet 100, win 200 total)

Andar has a slight statistical advantage due to the dealing pattern, so it pays slightly less to maintain game balance.
