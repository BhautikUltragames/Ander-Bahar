## 🔧 **Key System Components**

### **AnimatedCardDealer Widget (NEW)**

```dart
class AnimatedCardDealer extends StatefulWidget {
  final bool isDealing;
  final VoidCallback? onDealingComplete;
  final Function(bool toAndar, PlayingCard card)? onCardDealt;

  // Professional card dealing animations
  // Flying cards from dealer to piles
  // Synchronized across multiplayer
  // Performance optimized
}
```

**Key Features:**

- **✅ Flying Card Animations** - Cards fly from dealer to piles
- **✅ Synchronized Multiplayer** - All players see same animations
- **✅ Performance Optimized** - Efficient animation controllers
- **✅ Professional Polish** - Smooth transitions and timing

### **WebSocketService (Multiplayer)**

```dart
class WebSocketService extends ChangeNotifier {
  // Global room connection management
  Future<void> connectAndJoinGlobal(String playerName)

  // Betting system
  void placeBet(String side, int amount)

  // Game state management
  void disconnect() // Clean disconnection

  // Real-time updates with card animations
  Stream<GameState> get gameStateStream
}
```

**Key Improvements:**

- **✅ Global Room System** - Single room for all players
- **✅ Complete Disconnection** - Proper WebSocket cleanup
- **✅ Real-time Updates** - Live game state synchronization
- **✅ Simplified API** - Easy connection management
- **✅ Animation Support** - Handles card dealing synchronization

### **Server Architecture (Node.js)**

```javascript
class GlobalGameRoom {
  // Continuous round management
  startContinuousRounds() // 10-second cycles

  // Player lifecycle
  addPlayer(ws, name) // Add new player
  removePlayer(playerId) // Complete removal

  // Game logic
  placeBet(playerId, side, amount)
  processBetting() // Handle betting phase
  dealCards() // Server-authoritative dealing with animation triggers
  calculateResults() // Winner determination

  // Real-time sync with animation support
  broadcastGameState() // Update all clients
  broadcastCardDealt(card, toAndar) // Trigger animations
}
```

**Key Features:**

- **✅ Continuous Rounds** - Automatic 10-second cycles
- **✅ Complete Player Removal** - No ghost players
- **✅ Animation Synchronization** - All players see same card animations
- **✅ Bundled Runtime** - No separate Node.js installation

---

## 🎨 **UI/UX Architecture**

### **Hover Animation System**

```dart
class HoverButton extends StatefulWidget {
  final Widget child;
  final VoidCallback onTap;
  final double hoverScale = 1.05;
  final Duration animationDuration = Duration(milliseconds: 200);

  // Smooth hover effects throughout the app
  // Professional visual feedback
  // Accessibility compliant
}
```

### **Color Psychology Implementation**

```dart
// Strategic color choices for optimal user experience
const Color ANDAR_COLOR = Colors.blue.shade700;      // Trust, stability
const Color BAHAR_COLOR = Colors.yellow.shade700;    // Luck, prosperity
const Color JOKER_BACKGROUND = Color(0xFFFBC02D);    // Attention, focus

// High contrast text for accessibility
const Color ANDAR_TEXT = Colors.white;               // White on blue
const Color BAHAR_TEXT = Colors.black;               // Black on yellow
```

### **Responsive Design System**

```dart
// Optimized button sizing
const double MAIN_BUTTON_WIDTH = 0.7; // 70% of screen width
const double MAIN_BUTTON_HEIGHT = 120.0;
const double SECONDARY_BUTTON_HEIGHT = 70.0;

// Consistent spacing and typography
const double TITLE_FONT_SIZE = 32.0;
const double MAIN_BUTTON_FONT_SIZE = 28.0; // Increased for better readability
const double SECONDARY_BUTTON_FONT_SIZE = 18.0;
```

---

## 🎯 **Animation System**

### **Card Dealing Animations**

```dart
class _AnimatedCardDealerState extends State<AnimatedCardDealer>
    with TickerProviderStateMixin {
  late AnimationController _dealerController;
  late AnimationController _cardController;

  // Flying card animation from dealer to pile
  void _triggerCardAnimation(PlayingCard card, bool toAndar) {
    // Professional card dealing with smooth transitions
    // Synchronized across all multiplayer clients
    // Performance optimized for smooth gameplay
  }
}
```

### **Hover Effects**

```dart
// Professional hover animations throughout the app
MouseRegion(
  onEnter: (_) => setState(() => isHovered = true),
  onExit: (_) => setState(() => isHovered = false),
  child: AnimatedScale(
    scale: isHovered ? 1.05 : 1.0,
    duration: Duration(milliseconds: 200),
    curve: Curves.easeInOut,
    child: buttonWidget,
  ),
);
```
